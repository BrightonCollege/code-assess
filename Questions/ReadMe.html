<body>
<div>
<p>Folder containing questions. <br>
The format of questions will be Json: <br>
There is an array called Questions containing objects. Each object is a question of the quiz  with QuestionText being the text of the question, and Answers containing 4 Strings(4 variants), followed by a number which indicated the correct result. <br>Later for each file we can add score, and number of questions if required. Although I think using .length function in js will be better. </p>
