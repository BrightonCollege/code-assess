\f0\fs24 \cf0 Folder containing questions.\
The format of questions will be Json:\
There is an array called \'93Questions\'94 containing objects. Each object is a question of the quiz  with \'93QuestionText\'94 being the text of the question, and \'93Answers\'94 containing 4 Strings(4 variants), followed by a number which indicated the correct result. Later for each file we can add score, and number of questions if required. Although I think using .length function in js will be better.}
