# JSON work

Folder containing questions.

The format of questions will be Json:  
There is an array called Questions containing objects. Each object is a question of the quiz  with QuestionText being the text of the question, and Answers containing 4 Strings(4 variants), followed by a number which indicated the correct result.

Later for each file we can add score, and number of questions if required. Although I think using .length function in js will be better.
